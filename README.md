 Wanting positive experience is a negative experience
; accepting negative experience is a positive experience.
the more you pursue feeling better all the time, 


the less satisfied you become, as pursuing something only reinforces the fact that you lack it in the first 
place. The more you 
desperately want to be rich, the more poor and unworthy you feel, regardless of how much money you actually make. 
The more you desperately
 want to be sexy and desired, the uglier you come to see yourself, regardless of your actual physical appearance. 
 The more you desperately want to be happy 
and loved, the lonelier and more afraid you become, regardless of those who surround you. 
The more you want to be spiritually enlightened, the more self-
centered and shallow you become in trying to get there.

We feel bad about feeling bad. We feel guilty for feeling guilty. We get angry about getting angry. We get 
anxious about feeling anxious. What is wrong with me?

Subtlety #1: Not giving a fuck does not mean being indifferent; it means being comfortable with being different.
Subtlety #2: To not give a fuck about adversity, you must first give a fuck about something more important than adversity.
I once heard an artist say that when a person has no problems, the mind automatically finds a way to invent some.
It then follows that finding something important and meaningful in your life is perhaps the most productive use of your time and energy. Because if you donâ€™
t find that meaningful something, your fucks will be given to meaningless and frivolous causes.
Subtlety #3: Whether you realize it or not, you are always choosing what to give a fuck about.
The idea of not giving a fuck is a simple way of reorienting our expectations for life and choosing what is important and what is not. Developing this ability
 leads to something I like to think of as a kind of â€œpractical enlightenment.â€

There is a premise that underlies a lot of our assumptions and beliefs. The premise is that happiness is algorithmic, that it can be worked for and earned and
 achieved as if it were getting accepted to law school or building a really complicated Lego set.
If I achieve X, then I can be happy. If I look like Y, then 
I can be happy. If I can be with a person like Z, then I can be happy.
This premise, though, is the problem. Happiness is not a solvable equation. Dissatisfaction and unease are inherent parts of human nature

What pain do you want to sustain?â€ The path to happiness 
is a path full of shitheaps and shame.
What is the pain that you want to sustain? 
Itâ€™s what makes me, me, and you, you. Itâ€™s what defines us and separates us
 and ultimately brings us together.

Happiness Comes from Solving Problems

Who you are is defined by what youâ€™re willing to struggle for
our 
struggles determine our successes. Our problems birth our happiness, along with slightly better, slightly upgraded problems.
Because 
the joy is in the climb itself.

To be happy we need something to solve. Happiness is therefore a form of action; itâ€™s an activity, not something that is passively bestowed upon you, not 
something that you magically discover in a top-ten article on the Huffington Post or from any specific guru or teacher. It doesnâ€™t magically appear when you
 finally make enough money to add on that extra room to the house. You donâ€™t find it waiting for you in a place, an idea, a jobâ€”or even a book, for that 
matter.

Whatever your problems are, the concept is the same: solve problems; be happy. Unfortunately, for many people, life doesnâ€™t feel that simple. Thatâ€™s 
because they fuck things up in at least one of two ways:
1.Â Â Â Denial. Some people deny that their problems exist in the first place. And because they deny reality, they must constantly delude or distract 
themselves from reality. This may make them feel good in the short term, but it leads to a life of insecurity, neuroticism, and emotional repression.
2.Â Â Â Victim Mentality. Some choose to believe that there is nothing they can do to solve their problems, even when they in fact could. Victims seek to 
blame others for their problems or blame outside circumstances. This may make them feel better in the short term, but it leads to a life of anger, 
helplessness, and despair.
People deny and blame others for their problems for the simple reason that itâ€™s easy and feels good, while solving problems is hard and often feels bad. 
Forms of blame and denial give us a quick high. They are a way to temporarily escape our problems, and that escape can provide us a quick rush that makes us 
feel better.

Emotions Are Overrated
This is why our problems are recursive and unavoidable. The person you marry is the person you fight with. The house you buy is the house you repair. The 
dream job you take is the job you stress over. Everything comes with an inherent sacrificeâ€”whatever makes us feel good will also inevitably make us feel bad
. What we gain is also what we lose. What creates our positive experiences will define our negative experiences.
